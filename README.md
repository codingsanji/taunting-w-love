<h3>Heard this was a trend so while I was trying to code it in web , I decided why not add my own twist to it and send to my loved ones to annoy them a bit hahahaha soo here you go</h3>
<h4>So basically it's gonna ask you 2 questions -- 1 being Do you like me? and if that is answered right then you get question 2 which is Do you love me?
Of course , whoever is running this code is gonna keep pressing yes for the first question without knowing you expect a no and so the yes button is just gonna keep changing positions until user decides they have no choice but to press no. Then we get the 2nd question and now , user is expected to press yes aaaaannnddd if they press no , the same changing positions thing is gonna keep happening FOREVER hahahaha....After passing through these 2 questions you'll be rewarded with a celebratory "I love you too" page.</h4>

<h3>This is what the 1st question is gonna look like :</h3>

<h3>......And here's how the end is gonna look (yes , there is falling confetti--actually just colored balls but yeah I tried....maybe someday when I figure it out , I'll come back and improve it) :</h3>
